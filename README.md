2. Define color constants and load images for the game and create font objects for text rendering and set up variables for game state tracking.
3. Display the opening stage by showing the opening image for a short period.
4. Enter the game loop and draw the TicTacToe board on the screen.
5. Draw the current positions on the board and check for win conditions.
